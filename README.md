# Raytracer
Just a simple raytracer built for learning purposes. I will be building this using 'The Ray Tracer Challenge' written by Jamis Buck.

Current progress: Simple vector and points library (the generic 'Tuples' data type in the book) has been implemented. The next step is to create a canvas. I have had a simple guess of what is needed here but have not started properly.

I will include broad documentation in each header file, detailing like-minded functions and operators. For more complex functions and data structures I will add detailed comments into the implemntation (so far this has not been needed).
