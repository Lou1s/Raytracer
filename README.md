# Raytracer
Just a simple raytracer built for learning purposes. I will be building this using 'The Ray Tracer Challenge' written by Jamis Buck. The plan is to live render the raytracing via a glfw/openGL window, as well as have the option to save it out as an image. I also hope to eventually add a primitive GUI via Nuklear.
