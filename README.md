# Raytracer
Just a simple raytracer built for learning purposes. I will be building this using 'The Ray Tracer Challenge' written by Jamis Buck.

Current progress: Simple vector and points library (the generic 'Tuples' data type in the book) has been implemented along with some basic canvas and colour functionality. I'm just getting into the Matrix stuff now and have done multiplication and a few things around that. I've locked the matrix struct in as a 4x4 matrix only for now as that should really be all that is needed.
