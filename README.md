# Raytracer
Just a simple raytracer built for learning purposes. I will be building this using 'The Ray Tracer Challenge' written by Jamis Buck.

Current progress: Simple vector and points library (the generic 'Tuples' data type in the book) has been implemented along with some basic canvas and colour functionality. I'm just getting into the Matrix stuff now and have done multiplication and  a few things around that. Currently the matrix struct and functionality is a bit generalised (supporting matrices of any dimensions), I'm debating whether or not to lock it down solely to 4x4 matrices, but will leave it as is for now.
